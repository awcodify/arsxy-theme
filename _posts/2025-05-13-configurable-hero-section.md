The homepage hero section is often the first thing visitors see when they land on your website. It's a crucial element for making a strong first impression and communicating your site's purpose. With the latest update to Arsxy Theme, you now have complete control over the hero section through simple configuration options.

## Hero Section Configuration Options

The new hero section configuration allows you to:

- Enable or disable the hero section completely
- Customize the title and subtitle text
- Change the hero image
- Configure custom buttons with different styles and links

All of these options are available through the `_config.yml` file, making it easy to adjust your homepage without editing any HTML or CSS.

## How to Configure the Hero Section

To customize your hero section, open your `_config.yml` file and look for the `hero` configuration section:

```yaml
# Hero section configuration
hero:
  enabled: true
  title: "Welcome to Arsxy Theme"
  subtitle: "A clean, modern Jekyll theme for tech blogs and documentation"
  image: "theme-demo.jpeg"
  buttons:
    - label: "Learn More"
      url: "/about/"
      primary: true
    - label: "GitHub"
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername/sysctl-theme"
      primary: false
```

### Understanding the Configuration Options

- **enabled**: Set to `true` to show the hero section or `false` to hide it completely
- **title**: The main heading for your hero section
- **subtitle**: A brief description or tagline that appears below the title
- **image**: The filename of the image to display (should be located in your `assets/images/` directory)
- **buttons**: An array of buttons that will appear in the hero section
  - **label**: The text to display on the button
  - **url**: The destination URL when the button is clicked
  - **primary**: Set to `true` for a primary button style (highlighted) or `false` for a secondary style

## Examples

### Disabling the Hero Section

If you prefer a minimal homepage without a hero section, simply set `enabled` to `false`:

```yaml
hero:
  enabled: false
```

### Creating a Custom Welcome Message

Customize the title and subtitle to create a personalized welcome message:

```yaml
hero:
  enabled: true
  title: "Welcome to My Tech Blog"
  subtitle: "Exploring software development, DevOps, and cloud technologies"
  # rest of configuration...
```

### Adding Multiple Call-to-Action Buttons

You can add as many buttons as you need, each with its own style and destination:

```yaml
hero:
  # other settings...
  buttons:
    - label: "Start Learning"
      url: "/tutorials/"
      primary: true
    - label: "Join Community"
      url: "/community/"
      primary: false
    - label: "View on GitHub"
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername/project"
      primary: false
```

## Best Practices for Hero Sections

For the most effective hero section:

1. **Keep your title concise** - Aim for 4-8 words that clearly communicate your site's purpose
2. **Use a descriptive subtitle** - Provide additional context about your blog or products
3. **Limit buttons to 2-3** - Too many options can overwhelm visitors
4. **Choose high-quality images** - Make sure your hero image is visually appealing and relevant
5. **Test on mobile devices** - Ensure your hero section looks good on smaller screens

## Conclusion

The configurable hero section in Arsxy Theme gives you the flexibility to create a homepage that perfectly matches your brand and content strategy. Whether you want to showcase your latest products, welcome visitors with a personal message, or keep things minimal, you now have the tools to do so through simple configuration options.

## Advanced Hero Customization

If you need even more customization beyond what the configuration options provide, you can create a custom hero by:

1. Creating a new file at `_includes/hero.html`
2. Adding your custom hero HTML in this file
3. Editing `_layouts/home.html` to include this file instead of the default hero

This gives you complete control over the hero section's HTML structure while still maintaining the ability to disable it through the `hero.enabled` configuration option.
