We're thrilled to announce the most significant update to Arsxy Theme yet: the **Social Media-Inspired Home Layout** (`home-v2`)! This innovative layout transforms your traditional blog homepage into a modern, engaging experience that draws inspiration from popular social media platforms while maintaining the professionalism your readers expect.

## 🌟 What Makes This Layout Special?

The new `home-v2` layout isn't just another homepage design—it's a complete reimagining of how readers discover and interact with your content. We've carefully studied modern user behavior and social media interaction patterns to create a layout that feels familiar yet fresh.

### Key Highlights at a Glance

- **Instagram-Style Stories Navigation** with gradient rings and smooth interactions
- **Social Media Post Cards** featuring author avatars, reading time, and action buttons
- **Interactive Controls** for filtering and view switching (feed vs. grid)

```yaml
---
title: "Your Amazing Post"
categories: [Tutorial, Features, Demo]
---
```

  --home-v2-accent: #8b5cf6;
  /* 20+ customizable properties */
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Implementing the new layout is incredibly simple:

### 1. Create Your Homepage

```yaml
---
layout: home-v2
title: "Welcome to My Blog"
description: "A modern homepage experience"
---
```

### 2. Configure Your Site

Add author information to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
author: "Your Name"
author_avatar: "/assets/images/author.jpg"
description: "Your engaging site description"
```

### 3. Optimize Your Posts

For the best experience, use this post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
author: "Author Name"
author_avatar: "/assets/images/author-avatar.jpg"
featured: true  # For featured badge
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
image: "post-featured-image.jpg"
reading_time: 5  # Optional, auto-calculated if not provided
---
```

### 4. Add Category Images (Optional)

Place category-specific images in `/assets/images/categories/` for enhanced visual appeal. The layout gracefully falls back to emoji representations if images aren't available.

## 🔄 Seamless Layout Switching

One of the best features? You can easily switch between layouts without any data loss:

### Traditional Blog Layout
```yaml
---
layout: home
---
```

### Modern Social Media Layout
```yaml
---
layout: home-v2
---
```

Both layouts work with the same content and configuration—choose what fits your brand!

## 🌐 Browser Support & Compatibility

The layout supports all modern browsers with graceful degradation:
- **Chrome 80+**
- **Firefox 80+**
- **Safari 13+**
- **Edge 80+**

Advanced features like native sharing provide enhanced experiences where supported, with smart fallbacks ensuring functionality everywhere.
