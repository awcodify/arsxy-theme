## Clean, Fast, and SEO-friendly

Sysctl Theme is designed with these principles in mind:

- **Clean Design**: Minimal, distraction-free reading experience
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for quick loading times
- **SEO Best Practices**: Built-in support for meta tags and structured data
- **Responsive Layout**: Looks great on all devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Easy on the eyes during night-time reading

## Markdown Features

This theme has great support for standard Markdown features. Here are some examples:

### Typography

The typography is optimized for readability with careful attention to:

- Font sizes and weights
- Line height and spacing
- Contrast and readability

### Lists

Unordered lists:

* Item one
* Item two
* Item three
  * Nested item

Ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's styled to stand out from the rest of the text, making it perfect for quotes or calling out important information.

### Tables

| Feature       | Supported | Notes                           |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Responsive    | Yes       | Tables adjust to screen size     |
| Sorting       | No        | Use plugins for sorting          |
| Zebra striping| Yes       | Alternate rows are highlighted   |

## Code Highlighting

This theme includes excellent syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Call the function
const message = greet('World');
```

```ruby
# Ruby example
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

# Call the method
message = greet('World')
```

```css
/* CSS example */
.theme-toggle {
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  color: var(--text-color);
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

.theme-toggle:hover {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

## Images

- Dark/light mode toggle
