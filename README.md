### Creating Posts

Create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your post for SEO and previews."
categories: Category
tags: tag1 tag2 tag3
image: path/to/featured-image.jpg
---

Your content goes here...
```

### Featured Images

For best results, use featured images in your posts. The recommended image size is 1200Ã—630 pixels for optimal display on both the homepage and social media shares.

### Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated for posts. If you want to disable it for a specific post, add `toc: false` to the front matter.

## Customization

### Colors and Typography

You can override the default colors and typography by creating a `_sass/_custom.scss` file in your site and importing it in your `assets/css/main.scss`.
