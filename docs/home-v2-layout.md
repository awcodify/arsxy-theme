## How to Use

### 1. Enable the Layout

Create a new page or modify an existing one to use the `home-v2` layout:

```yaml
---
layout: home-v2
title: "Welcome to My Blog"
description: "A modern, social media-inspired homepage"
---
```

### 2. Configure Site Settings

Add comprehensive author information to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
author: "Your Name"
author_avatar: "/assets/images/author.jpg"
description: "Your engaging site description for the profile card"

# Optional: Homepage widgets configuration
home:
  stats_widget: 
    enabled: true
    title: "Site Statistics"

# Social media links for profile card
social:
  twitter: "yourusername"
  github: "yourusername"
  linkedin: "yourusername"
```

### 3. Optimize Your Posts

For the best experience, use comprehensive post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
author: "Author Name"
author_avatar: "/assets/images/author-avatar.jpg"
featured: true  # For featured badge and enhanced visibility
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
image: "post-featured-image.jpg"
description: "Engaging post description for card previews"
reading_time: 5  # minutes (optional, auto-calculated if not provided)
---
```

### 4. Add Category Images (Optional)

Place category-specific images in `/assets/images/categories/` for enhanced visual appeal:
- `tutorial.jpg` or `tutorial.webp`
- `features.jpg` or `features.webp`
- `demo.jpg` or `demo.webp`
- etc.

The layout gracefully falls back to emoji representations and default icons if images aren't available.

### 5. Configure Sidebar Widgets (Optional)

Customize sidebar widgets in your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# Sidebar configuration
sidebar:
  stats:
    show_posts: true
    show_categories: true
    show_tags: true
    show_reading_time: true
  
  popular_tags:
    limit: 10
    show_count: true
  
  trending_categories:
    limit: 6
    show_count: true
```

## Customization

### CSS Variables

  --home-v2-primary: #3b82f6;
  --home-v2-accent: #8b5cf6;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Dark Mode

The layout automatically supports dark mode through media queries:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --home-v2-bg: #0f172a;
    --home-v2-card-bg: #1e293b;

## Troubleshooting

### Stories Not Showing
- **Check Categories**: Ensure you have categories defined in your posts' frontmatter
- **Verify Images**: Check that category images exist in `/assets/images/categories/` or confirm emoji fallbacks are working
- **Category Limit**: The layout displays a maximum of 8 categories in stories navigation
- **Post Requirements**: Categories need at least one post with content to appear in stories

### JavaScript Features Not Working
- **Verify Script Loading**: Ensure `home-v2.js` is properly loaded and accessible
- **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser developer console
- **Layout Class**: Confirm the layout class `.home-v2` is present in the HTML
- **DOM Elements**: Verify required DOM elements exist (filter tabs, view toggles, etc.)
- **Browser Support**: Confirm browser supports modern JavaScript features

### Styling Issues
- **SCSS Import**: Check that `_home-v2.scss` is imported in your main stylesheet
- **CSS Variables**: Verify CSS custom properties are supported in target browsers
- **Dark Mode**: Test both light and dark modes separately for styling consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Test across different screen sizes and device orientations
- **Cache Issues**: Clear browser cache and rebuild site to see style changes

### Performance Issues
- **Image Optimization**: Ensure images are properly compressed and sized
- **Loading Speed**: Check for large files or unoptimized assets
- **JavaScript Performance**: Monitor for memory leaks or excessive DOM manipulation
- **Network Issues**: Verify all assets are loading correctly from CDN or local sources
- **Bundle Size**: Check JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes for optimization opportunities

### View Toggle Problems
- **LocalStorage**: Ensure browser supports localStorage for view persistence
- **Grid Layout**: Verify CSS Grid support in target browsers
- **Toggle Buttons**: Check that view toggle buttons have proper data attributes
- **Container Elements**: Confirm posts container has correct CSS classes

### Share Functionality Issues
- **Web Share API**: Native sharing requires HTTPS and modern browser support
- **Fallback System**: Verify copy-to-clipboard fallback works when native sharing unavailable
- **Social Links**: Check that social sharing URLs are properly formatted
- **Permissions**: Ensure any required permissions are granted for native sharing

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Touch Targets**: Verify all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes (44px)
- **Viewport Meta**: Ensure proper viewport meta tag is present
- **Touch Events**: Test touch interactions work correctly on mobile devices
- **Scroll Performance**: Check for smooth scrolling and no layout shifts

### Content Display Issues
- **Featured Posts**: Verify featured posts have `featured: true` in frontmatter
- **Author Information**: Check author names and avatar paths are correct
- **Reading Time**: Ensure reading time calculation is working properly
- **Post Excerpts**: Verify post excerpts or first paragraphs display correctly
