/* 
 * The following classes can be configured in _config.yml using the 'dark_mode_class' option.
 * These provide different options for making logos visible in dark mode:
 * 
 * - dark-parts-to-white-dark-mode: Primarily affects black/dark colors (closest option for targeting just black)
 * - all-to-white-dark-mode: Changes all colors to white (good for solid logos on transparent backgrounds)
 * - selective-lighten-dark-mode: Selectively lightens dark colors (better for logos with mixed colors)
 * - invert-in-dark-mode: Inverts all colors of the logo (best for black & white logos)
 * - outline-in-dark-mode: Adds a white outline/glow around the logo (good for darker logos)
 * - brighten-in-dark-mode: Increases brightness without inverting (good for colored logos)
 * 
 * Example configuration in _config.yml:
 * header_logo:
 *   enabled: true
 *   image: "/assets/images/logo.png"
 *   dark_mode_class: "dark-parts-to-white-dark-mode"
